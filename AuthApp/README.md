# Simple Authentication App w/ Express.js

This project is a basic user authentication system that allows users to sign up and sign in. It uses a combination of client-side HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a backend built using Node.js and Express, with JWT (JSON Web Token) for token-based authentication.


### Technologies Used
 - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (using Axios for API requests).
  
 - Backend: Node.js, Express
 - JWT: For authentication and token generation.
 - Axios: To handle HTTP requests in the frontend.

### Features
- Sign Up: Users can register by creating a username and password.
- Sign In: Registered users can log in with their credentials.
- Token-Based Authentication: Upon successful login, a JWT is generated and sent to the client, which can be used to access protected routes.
- User Info: After logging in, users can view their details (username and password).
